Hey there! 👋

I wasn’t planning to create this, but hey, let’s look professional (or at least try)! 🤞🏻
Who am I?

I’m Mafe—don’t overthink the name. I'm the kind of person who never leaves something until I fully understand it. Curiosity drives me, and I’m always eager to dive into new challenges and ideas.
What I’m into 🚀

I have a passion for everything digital. Whether it’s:

    Cryptocurrency 🪙
    Ethical hacking 🔐
    Exploring and learning different programming languages 💻

I’m on a mission to know everything about the digital world. Why stop when there’s so much out there to learn, right?
Why this README?

Honestly, I’m not someone who writes in a super-official tone. It’s just easier (and more fun) to be myself! 😊
